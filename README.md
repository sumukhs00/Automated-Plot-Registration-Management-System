A plot may also be defined as a small area of land that is empty except for a metalled road surface or similar improvement. This article covers plots as parcels of land meant to be owned as units by an owner(s), which is the evergreen running business in the world. “A lot or plot” is a tract or parcel of land owned or meant to be owned by some owner(s). A plot is essentially considered a parcel of real property in some countries or immovable property (meaning practically the same thing) in other countries. Possible owner(s) of a plot can be one or more person(s) or another legal entity, such as a company/corporation, organisation, government, or trust. The plot registration is one of the proof provided to the owner, that he owns a specific site/plot. As to reduce the human error and paper work the online plot registration is done, where sites can be registered. This going to help government/organisation in the registration of sites, where all the information of transaction will be saved in the database for the further use, which is useful for both the owner/user and admin in any circumstances.
